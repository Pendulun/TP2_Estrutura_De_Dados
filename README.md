 A Practical Exercise on Sorting Data Structures

<h2> The problem </h2> 
<p> Rick Sanchez is a intergalactical scientist that receives many invitations for lectures around the universe. As he usually accepts the invite, he reserves a <b>T</b> time in minutes for travelling across the universe for each month. This unique <b>T</b> time is applied for every month. </p>
<p> Rick wants to automatize his lectures agenda and so needs my help. He wants a program that, given the numbers of planets <b>P</b> and a <b>t</b> duration time that he will be staying in each planet, returns a sequence of planets that he can travel to for each month always respecting the <b>T</b> time that he setted as the maximum amount of time for every month.</p>
<p> The thing is that he wants to visit as most planets possible he can visit every month, so he wants to always visit the <b>k</b> planets with the lowest <b>t</b> duration of visit. Furthermore, he needs that every sequence of planets visited on each month be ordered by alphabetical order, independent of the <b>t</b> duration of visit of those planets.</p>
<p> Moreover, he assures that I can order the planets by <b>t</b> duration using a <b>stable and O(n(ln(n))) algorithm</b> and a <b>O(n*k) algorithm</b> to order alphabetically the planets</p>
